  <!--
    The acceptance validator test, for no reason other than it's first alphabetically,
    exercises all the flags of a validator: display, message, allow_null, allow_blank,
    only_if and unless.  This is the only validator that goes through that much 
    thoroughness.  I'm quite confident, since all validators share the same code, that
    if it works for one, it can work for all.  So not all flags are exercised as 
    tediously in all validators.  If you want to try any other combinations of flags,
    this is the place to do it.

  <!--
    The presence validator test is the one test that runs off a fully subclassed model,
    rather than one built on the fly in the "module" section of the test.  It is in
    the file test/js/coffee/presence_model.coffee.  Building models in this manner for
    every validator would be overkill, but I do want to exercise the capability at least
    once.  This is the place to do it.

  <!--
    This is the catch all if the test name is not one that is built in.  It should be
    the name of a method on the model, just like rails validation with custom methods.
